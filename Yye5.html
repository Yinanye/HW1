For this assignment, I feel like I learned a lot, and I feel like I did this assignment in another course but it's good to do it again to learn git in detaild. I feel like what I learned will be useful in future. Professor Colbert is really interesting and knowledgeable person, and I alreay took 3 semester's of his courses, all these are interesting courses and easy to understand. Last, as what I said in BPA project, I really love this class! I love Software Design!
